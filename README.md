# Principal Component Analysis using numpy

PCA is used to identify patterns in data and is used for data compression.

In this notebook,we do PCA using just numpy.It helped me grasp the concept doing it this way.The steps taken are based on [this](http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/cosc453/student_tutorials/principal_components.pdf)tutorial which I found to be very helpful.
